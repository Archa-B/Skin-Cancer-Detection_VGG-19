# Skin-Cancer-Detection_VGG-19
->Skin cancer detection using transfer learning model VGG-19.

AIM: 
To build an automated classification system based on image
processing techniques to classify skin cancer.

MOTIVATION:
#The overarching goal is to support the efforts to reduce the
death caused by skin cancer.

#To use the advanced image classification technology for the
well-being of the people.

#To reduce the gap between diagnosing and treatment.

#Successful completion of the project with higher precision on the
dataset could better support the dermatological clinic work.

#The improved accuracy and efficiency of the model can aid to
detect melanoma in the early stages.
